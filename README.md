## Lab 1 Socket

In this experiment, I developed a streamlined multi-user chat program using socket technology. This application leverages stream sockets, implements multithreading, facilitates concurrent online conversations in both English and Chinese, incorporates timestamp display, and provides features for group and private messaging. Additionally, it includes a well-defined exit mechanism for users.
